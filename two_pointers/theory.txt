Does my problem match this pattern?

    Yes, if all of these conditions are fulfilled:

        The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, it’s in an array, in a linked list, or in a string of characters.

        We limit our focus to a specific range of elements within the input data, as dictated by the positions of the two pointers, allowing us to consider a small subset of elements rather than the entire set.

Additionally, problems in this pattern usually involve comparing or swapping values pointed to by two indexes. In less common cases, each index may move along a separate array or string.

    No, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:
        The input data cannot be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, it’s neither in an array, nor in a linked list, nor in a string of characters.
        The problem requires an exhaustive search of the solution space, that is, eliminating one solution does not eliminate any others.
