Does my problem match this pattern?

    Yes, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:

        Either as an intermediate step, or as the final solution, the problem requires identifying:
            the first x %x % of the elements in a linked list, or,
            the element at the kk-way point in a linked list, for example, the middle element, or the element at the start of the second quartile, etc.
            the kthkth last element in a linked list

        Solving the problem requires detecting the presence of a cycle in a linked list.

        Solving the problem requires detecting the presence of a cycle in a sequence of symbols.

    No, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:
        The input data cannot be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, itâ€™s neither in an array, nor in a linked list, nor in a string of characters.
        The problem can be solved with two pointers traversing an array or a linked list at the same pace.
